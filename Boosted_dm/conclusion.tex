\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
A search for an excess of electron-elastic-scatter-like events from the galactic center or the sun was preformed over 2628.1 days of SK-IV data, which corresponds to 161.9 kton-years.  No excess above atmospheric neutrino background was observed around with the galactic center of the sun.  Limits were computed for a simple boosted dark matter model which would be expected to produce such events in SK, and in the region of $E_\textrm{max}>10 GeV$, the 90\% CI upper limit on $\sigma_\textrm{tot}/m_A^2$ was found to be $1.5 \times 10^{-37}$ (cm$^2$/GeV$^2$) for $m_{\gamma '}=20$ MeV and the NFW galactic halo model.
